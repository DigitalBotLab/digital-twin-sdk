# Model Management

The Digital Twin SDK provides advanced model management capabilities, ensuring meticulous design and adaptability for evolving digital ecosystems. Users are equipped to define and dynamically manage Digital Twin models, making adjustments in alignment with real-world changes. Additionally, the SDK incorporates a sophisticated model versioning system, allowing users to track model iterations and understand their evolution over time. This is complemented by a strong emphasis on compatibility, ensuring that transitions between model versions are seamless and that interactions within the digital ecosystem remain consistent and integrated, irrespective of model updates.

## Define and manage Digital Twin models

Digital Twins are built upon well-structured models that dictate their attributes, behaviors, and interactions. With the SDK's model management feature, users can intricately define these Digital Twin models, tailoring them to match the intricacies of the entities they represent. But defining is just the start. Effective management requires adaptability and the ability to oversee and modify these models as real-world scenarios evolve. The SDK empowers users with a suite of tools to not just create, but also manage, update, and optimize these Digital Twin models, ensuring that they remain relevant, accurate, and aligned with the changing dynamics of the real and digital world.

## Model versioning and compatibility

In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, models inevitably undergo revisions and enhancements. The SDK recognizes the importance of tracking these changes, and thus offers a robust model versioning feature. This allows users to maintain a history of model iterations, making it easy to revert to previous versions or understand the evolution of a model over time. Alongside versioning, the SDK prioritizes compatibility. As models evolve, it's crucial that existing Digital Twins and systems can seamlessly interact with newer model versions. The SDK ensures that transitions between different versions are smooth and that there's a consistent level of compatibility, safeguarding the integrity of the digital ecosystem.
